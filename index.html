        When you made your photo visible to me, I felt something. I can’t fully
        explain it, but it meant more to me than I expected. When you deleted
        your account, I felt guilty, and the thought of possibly hurting you
        kept me up at night. I’ve been trying so hard to make things right.
      </p>
      <p class="apology-text">
        I know my words might have come across the wrong way, and I deeply
        regret it. I never meant to offend you. I value the connection we had,
        and it hurts to think that I might have been misunderstood. I just
        wanted to be helpful and kind, never to cause any pain.
      </p>
      <p class="apology-text">
        I can’t undo what’s been done, but I want you to know that I’ve learned
        from this. If I said anything that made you uncomfortable or upset, I am
        truly sorry. I never want to be the reason for your distress.
      </p>
      <p class="apology-text">
        I respect your space and your decisions. Please take all the time you
        need. No matter what, I’ll always appreciate you and everything you’ve
        done for me. I hope, someday, we can understand each other better and
        find a way to move forward.

        Jain Ji, I truly miss having you around. Things haven’t felt the same
        without you, and I’ve been thinking a lot about everything that
        happened. I know I messed up, and I never wanted to hurt you. If I could
        take back anything, I would, but all I can do is sincerely apologize and
        ask if you’d be willing to give me another chance.
      </p>
      <p class="come-back-text">
        You matter to me, and your presence was something I cherished. please

        Take care, and I hope to hear from you whenever you’re ready. Wishing
